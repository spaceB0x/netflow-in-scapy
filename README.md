# netflow-in-scapy
This is my implementation of Netflow Version 5 in Scapy, which has not yet been merged in the official scapy repo.

In order to get this working move this into wherever scapy exists on your file system under the directory ..../scapy/layers/.
On OSX this is /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/scapy/layers (or whatever version of python you are using).
